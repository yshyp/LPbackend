# LifePulse Backend - Enhancements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive enhancements made to the LifePulse backend, focusing on logging and OTP functionality.

## üöÄ New Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Logging System

#### ‚úÖ Winston Logger Integration
- **Structured JSON Logging**: All logs are in JSON format for easy parsing
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic daily rotation with compression
- **Multiple Log Files**: Separate files for different log types
- **Security**: Phone numbers are masked in logs (e.g., `+******7890`)

#### ‚úÖ Log File Types
- `error-YYYY-MM-DD.log`: Error-level logs (14 days retention)
- `combined-YYYY-MM-DD.log`: All application logs (14 days retention)
- `otp-YYYY-MM-DD.log`: OTP-specific logs (7 days retention)
- `user-activity-YYYY-MM-DD.log`: User activity logs (30 days retention)

#### ‚úÖ Log Categories
- **OTP Logs**: Creation, verification, failures, rate limiting
- **User Activity Logs**: Registration, login, profile access
- **Security Logs**: Failed attempts, suspicious activities
- **System Logs**: Server events, database connections
- **Error Logs**: Application errors with stack traces

### 2. Enhanced OTP System

#### ‚úÖ Database Storage
- **Complete OTP Records**: All OTPs saved with expiry, IP, user agent
- **Automatic Invalidation**: New OTPs invalidate previous unused ones
- **TTL Index**: MongoDB automatically deletes expired OTPs
- **Attempt Tracking**: Failed verification attempts are tracked

#### ‚úÖ Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 OTP requests per hour per phone
- **IP Tracking**: Client IP addresses logged for security
- **Attempt Limits**: Maximum 5 verification attempts per OTP
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired OTPs are automatically removed

#### ‚úÖ New OTP Schema Fields
```javascript
{
  phone: String,           // Phone number
  otp: String,             // 6-digit OTP
  type: String,            // LOGIN, REGISTRATION, PASSWORD_RESET
  isUsed: Boolean,         // Whether OTP has been used
  expiresAt: Date,         // Expiration timestamp
  attempts: Number,        // Number of verification attempts
  sentAt: Date,           // When OTP was sent
  usedAt: Date,           // When OTP was used
  ipAddress: String,      // Client IP address
  userAgent: String       // Client user agent
}
```

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### ‚úÖ OTP Management Routes (`/api/otp`)
- `GET /api/otp/stats/:phone` - Get OTP statistics for a phone
- `GET /api/otp/recent/:phone` - Get recent OTP records
- `GET /api/otp/analytics` - Get OTP analytics (admin)
- `POST /api/otp/cleanup` - Clean up expired OTPs (admin)

### 4. Enhanced Authentication Routes

#### ‚úÖ Improved Security
- **Request Information Logging**: IP addresses and user agents logged
- **Rate Limiting**: OTP request rate limiting implemented
- **Comprehensive Error Logging**: All errors logged with context
- **Security Event Tracking**: Failed attempts and suspicious activities

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced OTP Flow
1. **Rate Limit Check**: Verify user hasn't exceeded OTP limits
2. **Previous OTP Invalidation**: Invalidate unused OTPs for same phone/type
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Log creation, sending, and verification
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error logging and cleanup on failures
